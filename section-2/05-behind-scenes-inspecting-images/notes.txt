When you run 
> docker images
you will see the image size
the app itself is not that big though, it is very small in comparison to that total size

the base image is not built up again in addition to the app.
the image sizes all look large, but they are sharing the base image

If you want to know more about an image
> docker image inspect IMAGE-ID

Will see image id
Will see created at date
Will see configuration for containers, eg, environment variables, entry point, docker version being used and etc...
In the configuration file, you will see the operating system being used(node uses the linux operating system with docker).
Will have layers from the base image we are using(Eg we are using node, so the node layer has many internal layers of it's own).
