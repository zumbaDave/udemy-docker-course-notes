We have a python file that does not create any web server or anything like that. 
from random import randint

min_number = int(input('Please enter the min number: '))
max_number = int(input('Please enter the max number: '))

if (max_number < min_number): 
  print('Invalid input - shutting down...')
else:
  rnd_number = randint(min_number, max_number)
  print(rnd_number)

we don't have to install python on our computer to run this. 
We will put this into a docker image and container instead.

This app also has to interact with the user.
On docker hub, you can search for python and find official python images we can use

Docker file looks like
FROM python

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

CMD ["python", "rng.py"]

Then in terminal
> docker build .

Copy image id
Now like before we can create a container
> docker run IMAGE-ID

We are not exposing any ports as it is not a network based app, so we don't have to worry about that.

But if we run it as above, we get an error
We are unable to interact with the container..   
We are attached, but not so we can interact with it.

So we must do the following:
We could use -i or --interactive to enter interactive mode
This opens a standard input
But we usually combine this with -t or --tty
-t means it creates a terminal

so we do:
> docker run -i -t IMAGE-ID
OR
> docker run -it IMAGE-ID

Now what if we want to use the start command in attached mode so we can interact with the app
> docker ps
to get container name

> docker start -a CONTAINER-NAME
But does not really work

We need to run -i flag
But we do not need to run the -t flag because that is remembered from when we ran it
> docker start -a -i CONTAINER-NAME
and now it works as should.
