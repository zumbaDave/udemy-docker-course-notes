DELETING IMAGES
You cannot remove a running container
to remove a container
> docker rm CONTAINER-NAME OR MULTIPLE-CONTAINER-NAMES

or to remove all stopped containers
> docker container prune

The above does not remove images... it just removes containers

MANAGING IMAGES
To see all images
> docker images

This will show the size of the images.
the node image is 935mb
This size is the node and the operating system needed to run node

to remove images
> docker rmi IMAGE-ID OR LIST-OF-IMAGE-IDS

can only remove an image when it's container is removed first

To remove all images
> docker image prune

REMOVING CONTAINERS AUTOMATICALLY
add --rm flag to the run command to automatically remove the container when it exits

To run our server app in detached mode and removing the container when it exits
> docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm IMAGE-ID

Then when we stop the container, it will be removed
> docker stop CONTAINER-NAME

Using the --rm is common when running a server.  Because you would normally only stop the server if your code changed, and thus would have to rebuild the image anyways.
