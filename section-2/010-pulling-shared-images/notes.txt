PULLING AND USING SHARED IMAGES

First we will delete all local images
> docker prune -a

> docker pull 

But we will logout first to see if it works without having to be logged in

> docker logout

> docker pull madmuskoka/node-hello-world

This will download it
> docker images
will show the image locally

The image is public, so anyone can download it..

now we can run it
> docker run -p 8000:3000 -d --rm madmuskoka/node-hello-world

NOTES:
docker pull will always pull the latest image of that image name

if docker does not find that image name of madmuskoka/node-hello-world
then it will check docker hub, and pull that image and run it

But... docker will not check to see if the image you have on your local machine is the latest version.  It will not check to see if there is a newer version of that image on docker hub.

If you want to use the latest image version. you will have to run docker pull again, then docker run
