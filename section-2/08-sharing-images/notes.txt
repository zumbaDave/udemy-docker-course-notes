SHARING IMAGES

Everyone who has an image, can create containers based on that image
This means we do not share containers with others, but instead share images

We have two main ways of sharing images.
1) We can share the DockerFile and source code.
Then a person can create an image themselves.
That is how the images are shared with this course.

2) Can share a complete built image
Can just download an image and run a container from it.
