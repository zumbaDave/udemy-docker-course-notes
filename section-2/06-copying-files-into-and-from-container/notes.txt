may want to grab or put something into a container while it is already running

can use the cp command
In our app we will create a dummy folder with a test.txt file
this will will just have Hello! in it
first run a container
then
> docker cp dummy/. CONTAINER-NAME:/test

the above will copy all contents of dummy folder into the test folder of the container.
if the folder in the container does not exist, then it will create it.

Now how can we see this test folder in the container
to see if this worked, delete the test.text in the dummy folder
then we will copy the test.text from the test folder in the container, into the app dummy folder
> docker cp CONTAINER-NAME:/test dummy
This will put the entire test folder into the dummy folder, along with the test.txt file in it

or to just target the file
> docker cp CONTAINER-NAME:/test/test.txt dummy

When changing source code, you could copy that changed file into the container
BUT.... you don't really do that as it is error prone
It would be easy to forget a file and thus have strange behavior and/or errors
Will later learn how to update code in a container without rebuilding or restarting later in the course.
