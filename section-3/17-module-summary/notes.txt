SUMMARY

Containers can read and write data.
Volumens can help with data storage.
Bind Mounts can help with direct container interaction

CONTAINERS.
Can read and write data, but written data is lost if the container is removed

NAMED VOLUMES 
Survivor container removal and can therefore be used to store persistent data 

BIND MOUNTS 
Are folders on the host machine which are specified by the user and mounted into containers - like Named Volumes 

VOLUMES 
Are folders on the host machine, managed by Docker, which are mounted into the Container 

Anonymous Volumes 
Are attached to a container 
They can be used to save (temporary) data inside the container 
Can be set up on command line with -v command 
eg. -v feedback:/app/feedback 
Can have multiple volumes, just need to use -v again to name another one 

BUILD ARGuments AND Runtime ENVironment VARIABLES 
Can be used to make images and containers more dynamic and/or configurable
