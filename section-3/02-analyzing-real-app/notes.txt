DATA CATEGORIES

1) APPLICATION - SOURCE CODE AND ENVIRONMENT
is in the image, and cannot change without rebuilding image

2) TEMPORARY APP DATA(entered user input)
- is fetched and produced in running container
- stored in memory or temporary files
- dynamic and changing, but cleared regularly.
- read and write, stored in containers

3) PERMANENT APP DATA(er. user accounts).
- data that needs to persist
- fetched, produced in running container
- stored in file or a databaase
- must not be lost if container stops/restarts
- read/write, permanent, stored with Containers & Volumes.
- Volumes are a key concept with docker

When we run the app, it asks for feedback which it saves into a file.
this file is saved in the docker container, and you cannot find this file on your local machine....
So in vscode if you go into the feedback folder, you will not see it
this file is only in the running container

We will run the feedback app with the --rm
> docker run -p 3000:80 -d --name feedback-app feedback-node

then add Awesome feedback
then go to http://localhost:3000/feedback/awesome.text

Then stop docker container
now run the feedback app without the --rm
now go to
http://localhost:3000/feedback/awesome.txt

you will get a file not found error
that is because we removed the container in that last run
we can add the awesome feedback again, and it will work,
but that feedback file from the previous run is now deleted.
This file was not permanent.

now if we stop the container.
that container will not be automatically deleted
and we restart the app
> docker start feedback-app

now that awesome feedback file will still be there, because we did not delete the container.
So it is saved in the container, but not saved permanently elsewhere.

So if we remove the container, then that file will be removed as it is saved only in the container
