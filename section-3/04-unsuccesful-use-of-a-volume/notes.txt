UNSUCCESSFUL USE OF A VOLUME

Can add a command to dockerfile

-following is the path inside the container
VOLUME ["/app/feedback"]

then rebuild the image
> docker build -t feedback-node:volumes .

then run the container
> docker run -d -p 3000:80 --rm --name feedback-app feedback-node:volumes

now when we add a new feedback, the refresh spinner never stops, and is crashing.
something went wrong

to see what went wrong, 
> docker logs feedback-app

We are getting an error because of the express code in the server.js
we use the "rename" function in the server.js file and this is not allowed when moving a file from one device to another(which is kind of what we are doing with docker).

we can fix this by replacing the rename with the copyFile

await fs.rename(tempFilePath, finalFilePath);
to 
await fs.copyFile(tempFilePath, finalFilePath);
and add right under this line
await fs.unlink(tempFilePath);  // the above lines of code, copy the file and then manually delete it afterwards

now that we changed the source code, we have to rebuild, so we will remove the image first
> docker rmi feedback-node:volumes

now if you add feedback, it will work and the feedback file is created.

however..... it still does not work in that the data is not persistant

if we stop the container and remove it.
then start it again.., but that file is not there anymore
