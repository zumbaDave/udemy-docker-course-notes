Removing Anonymous Volumes
We saw, that anonymous volumes are removed automatically, when a container is removed.

This happens when you start / run a container with the --rm option.

If you start a container without that option, the anonymous volume would NOT be removed, 
even if you remove the container (with docker rm ...).

Still, if you then re-create and re-run the container (i.e. you run docker run ... again), 
a new anonymous volume will be created. So even though the anonymous volume wasn't removed automatically, 
it'll also not be helpful because a different anonymous volume is attached the next time the 
container starts (i.e. you removed the old container and run a new one).

Now you just start piling up a bunch of unused anonymous volumes - 
you can clear them via docker volume rm VOL_NAME or docker volume prune.
