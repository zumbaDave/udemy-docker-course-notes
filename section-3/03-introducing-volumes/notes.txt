VOLUMES

Volumes help us with persistant data

volumes are folders on your host machine hard drive which are mounted("made available" mapped) into containers)

Host: Your computer
/same-path ----> /app/user-data

So your folder on your local machine is mapped to a folder "inside" of the docker container

The COPY command in the Dockerfile takes a snapshot of a folder. and that snapshot is not dynamic

But with volumes you can connect a folder outside of your container with one in your container, and if something changes in either or, it will change in the other.

Therefore volumes all for persistant data

Containers can both read and write to a volume
