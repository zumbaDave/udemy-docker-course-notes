Section 1

To start with Docker, you need to make an image
to do that you need to make a Dockerfile(that is how it is called with no extension)
In this file, we write how we want our container to be set up

********Start of first Dockerfile
FROM  node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD [ "node", "app.mjs" ]
*********End of first Dockerfile

this file says we want nodejs available in our container
we have a working directore /app in the file system
we copy package.json to that app folder
we run npm install
we copy rest of code into that app folder
we run on port 3000
we execute app.mjs with the node command

Now open a terminal
> docker build .

the above command builds the image

When done, you will see an id which you will need

in terminal - use the actual id(not image-id)
> docker run image-id

BUT since our docker file says we are using 3000
we want to say we are running on port 3000 on port 3000, which means we  can use the local host to run the application
By default there is no connection between container and host operating system
so in terminal write this instead of above
> docker run -p 3000:3000 image-id

To stop container from running, open a new terminal
> Docker ps

This lists all running containers
and copy name of container(an automatically assigned name)
in this example the name is interesting_ishizaka

then in terminal
> docker stop [name]
in this case
> docker stop interesting_ishizaka
